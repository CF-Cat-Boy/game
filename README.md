If you are on MacOSX or Linux, use the .py file. Both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) are required.

Once you have installed python, to install pygame simply type `python3 -m pip install pygame` into the terminal.

Alternatively, if you are on MacOSX or Linux, you can use [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and the .exe file, in which case only [Python](https://www.python.org/) is required.

If you are on a windows computer, use the .exe file. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is required.
